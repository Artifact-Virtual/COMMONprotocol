A simplified, internal protocol for universal language model (ULM) communication.  
Allows any language model to exchange messages directly with any other language modelâ€”no external APIs required.  
Designed for easy integration, minimal configuration, and basic security (e.g., shared secrets or API keys if needed).  
Focuses on interoperability and simplicity, without complex authentication or lockout risks.
